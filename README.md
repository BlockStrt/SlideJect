### Built with

### What I learned
The read only property classlist is a great new practice that i will use.
Understood some great keyframe practice, transform/translate practice.
Also cool ways to position Nav bars making them active.


```ClassList Practice

toggleTag.addEventListener("click", function(){
    mainTag.classList.toggle("open")

  if (mainTag.classList.contains("open")){
      toggleTag.innerHTML = `<img src="/assets/close.svg"> Close`
  } else {
      toggleTag.innerHTML = `<img src="/assets/menu.svg"> Menu`
    }
```

### Continued development
Using what I've learned I will do some more advanced things the next Repo commit.
